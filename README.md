# Survey Tools

This is a collection of tools (currently just one tool, but aspirational!) used to generate HTML and JavaScript that can be used in Custom HTML fields for ActionKit surveys. Right now the HTML produced is specific to MoveOn's ActionKit templates, so it would need to be further templated to be useful for other organizations.
